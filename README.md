# Pix2Pix GAN for Saliency Detection: An Investigation into Fixation Prediction.   
A deep learning project for the MSc program in Democritus utilizing a pix2pix generative adversarial network and salient maps for fixation prediction.

A thorough report can be found in [Report.pdf](https://github.com/KonstantinosChaldaiopoulos/DeepLearningPix2Pix/blob/main/Report.pdf)
## Repository Structure
Here are the main files in the repository and a brief explanation of their function:

`Training-Testing-Files`: Contains files related to training and testing of the model.

`Presentation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook used for as an example of how you can execute the code.

`Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report on the project.

`dataloader.py`: For loading and pre-processing data.

`imports.py`: imports necessary libraries and modules.

`main.py`: The main file where the training process is initiated.

`models.py`: Contains the model definitions for the pix2pix GAN.

`presentation.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation of the project.

`requirements.txt`: Lists the  dependencies that need to be installed.

`testing.py`: A Python script used for testing the model.

`training_function.py`: Contains the training function used in the main script.

`utils.py`: Contains utility functions used across the project​1​.

## Code execution
Before running the scripts, make sure to install the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

``!pip install -r requirements.txt``

If you run the code in google colab simply follow the instructions in the [presentation.ipynb](https://github.com/KonstantinosChaldaiopoulos/DeepLearningPix2Pix/blob/main/Presentation.ipynb) file.

If you want to run the testing file without training the model, you can download the pretrained generator model from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfbrrswwalfay6h/generator_99.rar?dl=0).
